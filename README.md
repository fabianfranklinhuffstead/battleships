# battleships

<p>A solution for a simple Python battleship game. This is base on the 1967 plastic board game battleship.</p>

<h2>The task: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow user to select from a 5 * 5 grid</li>
  <li>Display when player selects battleship</li>
  <li>Allow user 3 turns till gameover</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact for fixes, changes further instructions</p>
<p>Future developments: Considerations - multiplayer, grid resize, graphic improvements.</p>
